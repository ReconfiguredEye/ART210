        <h5>Week 3 - 8/31/2020 Update</h5>
        <p>Greetings all.  In place of our missed ART 210 meeting today (Tuesday, September 1, 2020), I'm asking you to complete several items in preparation for Thursday's Zoom class meeting.</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Post a link to your p5js sketch repository in the #workshop channel in Slack Thursday, 9/3/2020, beginning of class.  There's a link that Raymond provided to help out. (<a href="https://msu-art210.slack.com/archives/C018SN633NK/p1598631556007100">Link</a>)</li>
            <li>Ensure that you have read both readings from Unit 1's home page.  </li>
            <li>Post at least one image or link to Slack in the #fa20-project-1 channel to an artist that you feel uses space and / or place in an interesting way. </li>
            <li>Come to our Zoom class session having selected an abstract / geometric image or painting from the provided Pinterest Board, or from another source.</li>
            <li>You should re-create this selected image using p5js before class.  This will be essential to make the most of your time in class Thursday.  Not having this recreated image will mean you are not prepare for class for the day. Check the Unit 1 Workshop link for more information (<a href="unitOne/unit1workshop.html">link</a>)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>note: to ensure everyone sees this information, I will be posting these expectations on our Blackboard site as well.</p>

        <div class="spacerTwo"></div>
        <h5>Week 2 - 8/27/2020 Update</h5>
        <p>This week we have put down the foundations for much of the rest of the semester.  The concepts and language discussed in Tuesdays lecture combined with the technical skills exercised today are enough to get us started on the next step, which will be assigning Project 1.  </p>
        <div class="spacerTwo"></div>

        <h5>Week 1 - August </h5>
        <p><strong>Welcome back to school...</strong> even if school doesn't look like how we left it</p>

        <p>
          <img src="assets/dd4.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the policies in the Syllabus (linked in the left column).  We will be covering these materials on the first day of class, but it couldn't hurt to glance at it before hand.  
        </p>

        <h5>
          Here's some resources you'll need to get your semester rolling
        </h5>
        <p>
          Missouri State University's COVID-19 response feed (<a href="https://www.missouristate.edu/Coronavirus/default.htm">link</a>) <br/>
          And MSU's specific Masking Policy (<a href="https://www.missouristate.edu/Coronavirus/masking-policy.htm">link</a>) (please note that this is subject to change)
        </p>
        <p>This information will be important not only as we make our way back into the routine of classes, but also as we change our understanding of routine given evolving realities</p>
